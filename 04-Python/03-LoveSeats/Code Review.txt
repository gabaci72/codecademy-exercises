Purpose
Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
Your code successfully creates a receipt system for the furniture store, calculating the total cost including sales tax and itemizing the purchased items.
Consider adding comments to explain each step of the process, especially where calculations are performed, to enhance understanding.

# Add the price of the Lovely Loveseat to the total
customer_one_total += lovely_loveseat_price

Ensure that all tasks are completed, such as adding the description of the Stylish Settee to the itemization if it was intended to be purchased.

customer_one_itemization += lovely_loveseat_description
# Add the description of the Stylish Settee if purchased
# customer_one_itemization += stylish_settee_description

Readability
Is the code easy to understand?
Your code is well-structured with clear variable names that describe the items and their prices.
Use consistent string delimiters for better readability. Consider using double quotes for all strings.

stylish_settee_description = """Stylish Settee. Faux leather on birch. 29.50 inches high x 54.75 inches wide x 28 inches deep. Black."""

Add spacing between logical sections of the code to improve readability.

customer_one_total += luxurious_lamp_price

customer_one_itemization += luxurious_lamp_description

Performance
Does the code run efficiently?
The code efficiently calculates the total cost and itemizes the purchases without unnecessary complexity.
Consider using a function to handle the calculation of the total cost and itemization for better reusability.

def add_item_to_receipt(item_price, item_description):
    global customer_one_total, customer_one_itemization
    customer_one_total += item_price
    customer_one_itemization += item_description

add_item_to_receipt(lovely_loveseat_price, lovely_loveseat_description)

Implement error handling for potential issues, such as invalid price values, to make the code more robust.

try:
    customer_one_total += customer_one_tax
except TypeError:
    print("Error: Invalid tax calculation.")
