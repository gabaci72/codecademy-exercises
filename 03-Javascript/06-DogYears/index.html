        We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to 
        account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. 
        In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s 
        life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
        
        Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
        
        The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
        Each year following equates to 4 dog years.
        Before you start doing the math in your head, 
        let a computer take care of it! With your knowledge 
        of math operators and variables, use JavaScript to 
        convert your human age into dog years.</p></div>
